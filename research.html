      I conducted CIS research on the Formalization of Permutation Networks
      through Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring (PURM) Program and part of
      the Deep Specification research team.
      <br />
      Permutation Networks are circuits of configurable switches, such that
      their output is always a permutation of the input. Our choice of
      permutation network was the Benes network. In order to prove and work with
      permutation networks, we used a proof-based programming language called
      Coq. We created circuitry and we used abstraction in the creation to
      simplify the composition to allow for ease in future use.
      <br />
      We had around 600 lines of definitions in Coq. We also had around 400
      total lines of proofs, totaling to around 1,000 lines of code. This also
      gave a 3:2 ratio of code to proofs. We attribute the proof size to
      using dependent types and our use of Ltac proof automation.

      I also conducted research for the first time on Pascal's Triangle at North
      Carolina's Governor's School East over the summer. My group and I derived
      recursive formulae for a pattern we founded called Consecutive Rows with
      Even Middle Terms (CREMT). We then created a Python program to generate
      and predict the total percentage of even numbers per row compared to every
      row before that.
      <br />
      We created a different program where odds were represented by a 1 and
      evens were 0. We correlated this convetion to the triangle row and
      generated 1’s and 0’s back. With this formula, we found that every row
      after a CREMT contains all odd numbers. This was the reason for an
      exponential growth of even values and exponential decay of odd values
      throughout the whole, infinite triangle.
      <br />
      We had many other findings as well! Some of which can be found
