      Conducted CIS research on the Formalization of Permutation Networks
      through Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring (PURM) Program and part of
      the Deep Specification research team.
      <br />
      Permutation Networks are circuits of configurable switches, such that
      their output is always a permutation of the input. Our choice of
      permutation network was the Benes network. In order to prove and work with
      permutation networks, we used a proof-based programming language called
      Coq. We created circuitry and we used abstraction in the creation to
      simplify the composition to allow for ease in future use.

      Conducted research on Pascal's Triangle at NCGSE over the summer. My group
      and I derived recursive formulae for a pattern we founded called
      Consecutive Rows with Even Middle Terms (CREMT). We then created a Python
      program to generate and predict the total percentage of even numbers per
      row compared to every row before that. We created a different program
      where odds were 1 and evens were 0 and it correlated the triangle row and
      generated 1’s and 0’s back. With this formula, we found that every row
      after a CREMT contains all odd numbers. This was the reason for an
      exponential growth of even values and exponential decay of odd values
      throughout the whole, infinite triangle.
