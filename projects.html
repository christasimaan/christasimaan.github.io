        <h3>Penn Cloud</h3>

        <h3>Senior Design</h3>
        For my senior design project, I worked with four others to use NLP
        models to combat the mental health crises. We analyzed Reddit data from
        global universities’ subreddit forums, focused on keywords that
        pertained to mental health and loneliness. We leveraged this data to
        examine the relationship between mental health and the respective
        university to analyze changes in sentiment of posts pertaining to mental
        wellness before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Informed by
        our analysis, we built a university-specific administrative dashboard
        that can offer universities an overview of students’ mental health
        status throughout the year. Our dashboard empowers wellness officials
        with an easy-to-understand visualization of the data and facilitates a
        positive change by providing insights into current sentiments and
        trends.

        <h3>PennOS</h3>
        This is my very own UNIX-like operating system, built in C. This
        includes programming a basic priority scheduler, FAT file system, and
        user shell interactions. We made both our own rendition of a UNIX-like
        operating system, PennOS, and another single standalone program,
        separate from the final PennOS executable, pennfat. Once PennOS is
        booted, it executes a shell which has many of its own built-in
        functions. There is no physical hardware involved, instead PennOS runs
        as a guest operating system, within a single process running on a host
        operating system. We accomplished the above with the use of a multitude
        of files.

          Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Refrigerator Workflow Redesign
        </h3>
        There were issues with the workflow and organization of human milk and
        formula in refrigerators and freezers at Children's Hospital of
        Philadelphia (CHOP). These problems included, but are not limited to:
        spills in the refrigerators and when pouring freshly pumped milk into
        storage containers, space constraints for bottles in the refrigerator,
        labeling issues, and workflow and process variability across CHOP. These
        issues impacted the workload of the nurses, which in turn has the
        potential to limit the quality of patient care. The purpose of our
        project was to explore root causes of these issues and identify
        potential solutions. After tons of user research, direct observations,
        and clinical research, we landed on a few different prototypes. First,
        we were inspired by the efficiency and simplicity of egg trays in
        refrigerators, we proposed a fridge storage tray solution to facilitate
        human milk and formula storage in hospital settings, while increasing
        space available and decreasing the mental workload for nurses at CHOP.
        We mocked-up and then 3D printed the fridge storage tray below. The
        prototype mimics egg trays’ segmented layout, offering modular
        compartments that facilitate organized storage. Each compartment is
        designed for easy access and a first-in, first-out (FIFO) arrangement,
        optimizing space and ensuring the use of milk before expiration. This
        solution optimizes the use of space and makes human milk storage much
        more compact than before. We recognized that the initial egg
        tray-inspired prototype still lacked space efficiency and adaptability
        with existing organizational processes. More specifically, the
        overwhelming consensus from nurses we spoke with and sent our
        questionnaire to was that space constraints were a major problem, and we
        wanted to tackle this more directly with our solution. To address these
        shortcomings, we looked towards lab storage designs for inspiration,
        leading to a modular approach that integrates seamlessly with nurses’
        existing workflows. Our new prototype allows milk bottles to be
        stackable, significantly reducing the space constraint, and also allows
        bottles to be accessed easily. Our redesign was mainly focused around
        space efficiency, modularity, ease of use, and workflow simplifications.
        For space efficiency, the new prototype prioritizes a compact design to
        maximize storage capacity in existing refrigeration units. It is the
        height of the shelves in the chop fridges which are about 7-8 rack
        units, and easily is able to be placed on a rack within the fridges. It
        is very modular, as there are inserts to be adaptable based on varying
        storage needs. It is easy to use as we ensure trays are user-friendly,
        easily replaceable, and compatible with the current practices within
        CHOP fridges. Last, but not least the modular design aligns with nurses’
        routines, allowing for quicker and error-free access to milk containers.
        Additionally, due to their size, nurses will be able to use more racks
        as needed, they are easy to replace if they break, and can have dividers
        put into sections off the tray. This could be by date pumped, date of
        expiration, patient, etc. This redesigned prototype represents a
        significant improvement, harmonizing with the dynamic environment of
        human milk and formula storage and simplifying management for the
        nursing staff.

        <h3>FlavorFinder</h3>
        FlavorFinder is designed to help alleviate the pain point of having
        certain ingredients and not knowing what to do with them either before
        they go bad as well as inspiring creativity in the kitchen. This project
        is designed to create and make an interactive interface that helps users
        select a recipe based on desired ingredients, ingredient quantities,
        nutritional value, prep time, cook time, recipe reviews, and so much
        more! This was done using SQL, JavaScript, Python, and more.
        <br />
        Our application has many different forms of functionality. To start, the
        website opens with a log-in/sign-up page that allows new users to
        sign-up and existing users to log-in to their account. The
        log-in/sign-up formal is followed by a home/recipes page that consists
        of a featured recipe and a top recipes table. Then, there is a search
        page where users can type in a name or description of a recipe they are
        looking for and use sliders to check on the time, content, recipe yield,
        ingredients, etc. The website then uses these search parameters to query
        the dataset and display the query result of the recipes that meet all
        the inputted preferences. Each individual recipe links to a page that
        displays all information about that recipe, including the ingredients
        list, prep time, cook time, instructions, nutrition facts, reviews, and
        more. This is followed by similar logic, but into a reviews page. The
        reviews page has a search bar as well to look for certain authors,
        reviews, or ratings. Lastly, there is also a Likes page which shows the
        recipes that a user has liked and saves them for the user to have easy
        access to.
        <br />
        We found the overarching dataset we used here on Kaggle. The dataset had
        two .csv files in it, one being Recipes which is found here and the
        other Reviews which are found here. The Recipes’ table is 716.4 MB.
        There were 522,569 rows before cleaning and after cleaning there were
        28,013 rows and 30 columns. The Reviews’ table is 504.9 MB. There were
        1,401,982 rows before cleaning and after cleaning there were 1,401,768
        rows and 8 columns.

        <h3>Climate Change Predictor</h3>
        We used an Earth Surface Temperature dataset, as well as two additional
        .csv files on both greenhouse gases and natural disaster rates in order
        to analyze information about the varying surface temperatures on Earth
        (and many of the possible consequences of such actions). This was done
        in a Jupyter Notebook using pandas, python, and machine learning
        techniques, SARIMA.
        <br />
        This project is rather interesting because climate change has been more
        and more of an increasing issue. We dove into how it has and will
        continue to affect countries, major cities, and states. The overall
        structure of our process was as follows: Data Wrangling of the State,
        City, and Country tables Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and
        Visualization of the Average Temperatures using machine learning to make
        temperature predictions connection to natural disasters. We use
        different techniques and figures to represent the interconnection and
        correlations between these surface temperatures with various possible
        atrocities so that we could see for ourselves the trends. This is a
        topic that often has misinformation and we have seen through working
        with the data that there are many exceptions from the overall trends
        that can be cherry picked in order to demonstrate certain narratives.
        <br />
        As a synopsis, we did data analysis pulling in four different .csv with
        around 700,000 rows of information in each. Then, we analyzed climate
        change over the years and calculated the predicted temperatures using
        regression in 2050 for different states, countries, and major cities. We
        also analyzed how climate change has an effect on natural disasters.
        <br />
        Our main challenge with the project above was that since data and
        temperatures fluctuate depending on where one is located in the world as
        the seasons are different, we were first using AutoRegressive Integrated
        Moving Average (ARIMA) and then did not get predictions which seemed
        correct. So, we used Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
        (SARIMA), which would give us seasonal information and data and then
        successfully were able to predict the 2050 temperatures based on our
        data sets.
        <br />
        The timeline in which we predict most of our models to span is until
        2050. We found that any further predictions would not reflect the state
        of the world accurately. We hope you enjoy the cool, groundbreaking
        results from this dataset and can potentially re-observe them in 2050 to
        see if the temperature predictions held true.

        <h3>Latchless</h3>
        Ideated, came-up with a product, completed assembly drawings, proof of
        concepts, schematic design, and more for my product, Latchless!
        Latchless is a portable contraption that lets you open and close your
        doors with ease. This new and improved doorstop allows for one to fully
        close their door all while making it latchless by successfully pushing
        the latch all the way back. By “removing” the latch, the door
        essentially becomes a swinging door and is thus able to open with just a
        nudge which is perfect for when you have a bunch of things to carry in.
        By having this contraption reside on your keys it is rather portable and
        it makes for easy access and trips inside when doing laundry, grocery
        shopping, moving-in, etc. It is very user-friendly and can be put on in
        seconds.
        <br />
        The prototype is an innovative and versatile product that combines four
        distinct components to create a single solution for a common problem. We
        utilized laser cut acrylic, stretchy elastic wrist band, key rings, and
        an adjustable strap. The laser cut acrylic is ⅛’ in order to have the
        door still be able to close, but strong enough to keep the latch back.
        The stretchy elastic wrist band allows for it to also be universal and
        stretch to size based on the width of the door handle from the latch.
        The key ring, made of sturdy metal, allows for connecting the parts
        together. The adjustable strap serves an essential purpose by allowing
        for the band to be adjustable and thus universal for every door.
        <br />
        This prototype has several advantages, including its versatility and
        durability, which make it an ideal solution for both personal and
        professional use. Its unique design and ease of use make it an
        attractive option for anyone looking for a practical and effective way
        to prevent doors from closing or to keep keys organized. Overall, this
        innovative prototype is a promising solution that has the potential to
        solve a common problem in a convenient and effective way.
        <br />
        In our product design fair, this product was awarded $448,672 due to the
        cost of production and the design fair tokens received (each attendee of
        the design fair was given three tokens simulating a product vote/buy)
        and received second place out of 43 different products at the fair.
