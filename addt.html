        Random, but important (at least to me) things.

      <h2>General philosophies/sayings I tend to live by:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything happens for a reason.</li>
        <li>Things get better with time.</li>
        <li>It is the people that make the place.</li>
        <li>Comparison is the thief of joy.</li>
        <li>If you do not believe in yourself, who is going to?</li>
        <li>A smile is the best thing one could wear.</li>
        <li>Everyone is someone.</li>
        <li>Say yes to (almost) everything.</li>
        <li>Some losses are gains.</li>
        <li>Do things that make you happy.</li>
        <li>Music is good for the soul.</li>
        <li>People never forget the way you made them feel.</li>
        <li>Perhaps coffee is addicted to me instead?</li>
        <li>It is the little things that are big things.</li>
        <li>You never know when you are making memories.</li>
        <li>When there is a will, there is a way.</li>
        <li>People come in and out of your life for different reasons.</li>
        <li>Be around people who make you forget you have a phone.</li>
        <li>Your soul is what makes you attractive (beauty is within).</li>
        <li>
          Just because someone carries it well, doesnâ€™t mean it is not heavy.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the days feel long remember that the weeks and years are short.
        </li>
        <li>If it makes you happy, there is no need for a justification.</li>
      </ul>
