      Hello! My name is Christa Simaan. I am a third-year student at the
      University of Pennsylvania in the School of Engineering and Applied
      Science, majoring in Computer and Information Science (CIS) and minoring
      in both Mathematics and Engineering Entrepreneurship. Currently, I am
      studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh for Fall 2022!
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a candidate for a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) in CIS on
      track to graduate in May 2024. In May 2024, I also plan to graduate with
      my Masters by submatriculating to then have both a BSE and MSE in CIS.

      in order to improve quality of life.

      With this being said, I provide a more holistic view of my life throughout
      the website. I hope you enjoy learning about me, what I do, and what I am
      most passionate about.
